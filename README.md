# AirAura

A professional global air-quality dashboard that fetches real API data and displays it using reusable React components.

## Overview

AirAura allows users to search for any city globally and view current air quality, pollutant breakdowns, weather context, and a 5-day air quality forecast. It demonstrates React API integration, component reusability, and robust error/loading state handling without relying on a backend.

## Features

- **Global city search** — powered by the Open-Meteo Geocoding API.
- **Air-quality data** — real-time AQI using the European Air Quality Index scale.
- **Pollutant information** — detailed breakdowns for PM2.5, PM10, O₃, NO₂, CO, and SO₂ using a highly reusable component.
- **Weather context** — contextual temperature, humidity, and wind speed data.
- **Forecast** — a 5-day daily aggregated air quality forecast.
- **Loading states** — custom skeleton UI matching the dashboard layout to indicate data fetching.
- **Error handling** — user-friendly error boundaries for network failures or location misses.
- **Responsive design** — adapts seamlessly from desktop to mobile screens using CSS Grid and Flexbox.
